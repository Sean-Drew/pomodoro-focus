# Pomodoro Productivity App

A pomodoro app to help with focus and productivity by identifying focus items and tracking them. 

You should type your focus item into the field and click the '+' button to add it. After adding an item you'll be brought to the timer page where you can specify either 10, 15, 30 or 45 minutes of focus (10 by default). The timer page includes a pause/start button if your work is interrupted and you need to temporarily stop the timer. There is also a cancel (-) button if you need to cancel your focus item completely.

The focus list is saved and displayed on the main screen. Items in green were completed (the timer ticked down to 0), while items in red were not completed (cancelled) so you can make note of things you might still need to do. The focus list can be cleared, to keep it tidy.

This app is powered with React Native and was written and tested using Expo, Expo Snack and Appetize.io services.
